# Visual Dark Theme
  * A fresh new theme for everyone who loves Visual Studio 2019 Dark Theme, but feels it could be done even better. 
  * Visual Dark Theme's UI design is inspired by some of the most well-crafted extensions in the marketplace - it's simple yet sophisticated. 
  * The theme works best for JavaScript/ TypeScript files but supports other languages as well. 
  * P.S. - Feel free to change anything you like through the settings.json file (you can read more about it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes#_customizing-a-color-theme)) or you could email me for design suggestions at stanislavyv@students.softuni.bg
