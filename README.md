# Visual Dark Theme
* A fresh new theme for everyone who loves Visual Studio 2019 Dark Theme, but feels it could be done even better. 
* Visual Dark Theme's UI design is inspired by some of the most well-crafted extensions in the marketplace - it's simple yet sophisticated. 
* The theme works best for JavaScript/ TypeScript files but supports other languages as well! 
* P.S. - Feel free to change anything you like through the settings.json file or you could email me for design suggestions at stanislavyv@students.softuni.bg
